# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP - CodTech Internship Task 3:
This project is developed as part of Task 3 of the CodTech IT Solutions Python Internship Program. The objective is to build a simple yet intelligent AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot interacts with users in natural language, simulating a friendly conversation while responding to various types of questions and prompts.

## Project Overview:
The objective of this task is to develop a Python-based chatbot that can respond meaningfully to basic user queries using predefined conversation patterns. By creating this chatbot, the project demonstrates how rule-based dialogue systems can be built using NLP libraries such as NLTK. The chatbot handles inputs like greetings, questions about Python and Artificial Intelligence, fun facts, jokes, and more. It helps learners understand how basic human-computer interaction can be simulated using a structured set of questions and answers. The project is intended to be both informative and engaging, while also being easy enough for beginners to modify and expand upon.

The chatbot is built using Python's nltk.chat.util module from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It uses a rule-based approach where user inputs are matched against pre-defined regular expression patterns, and the appropriate response is selected from a list of possible replies. This structure makes the chatbot lightweight, fast, and suitable for learning and experimentation without requiring any external datasets or complex training.

## Features of ChatBot:
This chatbot is equipped with several interactive features:
- Greet users with a welcome message
- Responds to greetings, user queries
- Answers python related questions by giving definitions for it
- Tells jokes and fun facts
- Provides fallback responses for unknown queries
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure
- Lightweight and runs entirely offline

## How the ChatBot works:
The chatbot operates on a rule-based system using a list of pattern-response pairs. Each pair includes a regular expression pattern that matches possible user input, along with one or more responses that the bot can use in reply. When a user types a message, the chatbot scans through the patterns to find the first one that matches. If a match is found, a corresponding response is randomly chosen and displayed. If no pattern matches, a default fallback response is used. The conversation logic is implemented through the NLTK Chat class, which streamlines the entire process of matching patterns and generating replies.
